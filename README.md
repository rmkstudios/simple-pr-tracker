Simple PR Tracker is a React site that connects with Firebase and allows multiple users to track and sort their workout records in a clean and simple to use interface that works on desktop and mobile.

## React Libraries Used

Most of the elements were created manually in HTML/CSS.
In addition, the Chakra UI library was used for form elements/buttons/menu dropdowns.

Everything is mobile-responsive and ready to roll on all devices.
